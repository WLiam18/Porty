# Porty
This is a Python script for a simple and efficient port scanner. It allows you to quickly scan a target host for open ports, which can be useful for network diagnostics and security assessments.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Run with Root/Admin Privileges:**
   - To perform port scanning effectively, ensure you run the script with root/administrator privileges.

3. **Syntax:**
   - Execute the script from the command line using the following syntax:
     ```bash
     python port_scanner.py <target_host> <start_port> <end_port>
     ```
   - Replace `<target_host>` with the IP address or hostname of the target system.
   - Specify the range of ports to scan by replacing `<start_port>` and `<end_port>`.

4. **View Scan Results:**
   - The script will scan the specified range of ports on the target host and display the status of each port (open or closed).
